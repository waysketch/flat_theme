# Blocks

## Summary
Blocks is what the user will be able to add to their page. These blocks stack on top of one another and make up the page visitors see.

## Add a Block to the list
So you've built a block that you want users to be able to add to their page.
Now head over to the `registry.js` located in the `src>pages>Page` folder. 

```CLI
root > client > src > blocks > registry.js
```
